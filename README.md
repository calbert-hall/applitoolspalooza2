# Applitoolspalooza 2.0 Interactive Workshop Directions

## 1. Set up a test plan to establish your environments and schedule your plan to not repeat. 
* Have 3 different environments (browsers / viewports).

## 2. Create 3 Custom workflows on your project. Associate each with the plan in #1. 
* Each must have multi-step functional workflows of a **User Journey**. Use multiple Visual Validations.
* Include a test with a hover or text field entry. Get creative!
* Utilize at least 1 of the “Advanced Settings”, i.e. test with “Layout” and enable “useDom” for better dynamic content analysis. 

*If your project is inaccessible for any reason, let the Applitools team know. If we can’t get it working today you can use imaginelearning.com for today.*
